                    Western India comprises three large states, one small state and two minuscule union territories.
                    This is the most heterogeneous of India's regions, with the states differing dramatically from one another in language, culture and levels of economic development. 
                    Maharashtra and Gujarat are among the most industrialized states of India, 
                    while Rajasthan and Goa are magnets for tourists, though for different reasons.
